### How to use this repository

This repository has folders for each in-class lab covered in CPRG312 course and a unified react frontend which has basic UI to interact with the backend we are developing in class.

If you want to run any particular lab (backend server)

1. In command prompt/terminal navigate to that lab folder.
2. Run >npm install
3. Follow the instructions on how to config lab specific setting in the README.md file of that particular lab
   - Caching Demo (No configuration required)
   - [Lab_HttpsDemo](./Lab_HttpsDemo/README.md)
   - [Password_Lab](./Password_lab/README.md)
   - [RBAC_Lab](./RBAC_Lab/README.md)
4. Run > node app.js

Now you server is running and you can test it using postman. If you want to use the unified frontend also then

1. Navigate to **unified_frontend** in command prompt/terminal
2. run npm install
3. Run >npm run dev
